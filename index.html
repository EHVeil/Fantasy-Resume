          <article>I, Benedict Timothy Carlton Cumberbatch, was born in 1976 London, England.
            I always knew that I wanted to be a professional Faker for a living, and as such I enrolled in the schools Brembletye, and Harrow.
            Whilst attending these schools I was a Painter, and a Faker.
            Post graduation I took some time to be an English teacher in Darjeeling, India, where I daresay I learned more than I taught.
            I am currently a professional Faker with many pieces under my belt.
